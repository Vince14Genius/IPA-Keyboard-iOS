An iOS keyboard for typing symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

Join the [beta test on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/lPas1HHg) to preview upcoming features and help us find bugs!

## Purpose

- Most IPA symbols cannot be typed using regular keyboards

- Full Unicode keyboards are too hard to navigate; an IPA-specific keyboard would have demand among linguistics hobbyists

- All IPA Keyboards on the App Store before mine was released were either...
  - non-free
  - full of ads
  - poorly designed, or
  - only included the subset of the IPA that's relevant to English (as opposed to the full IPA chart)

- This project aimed to solve *all* of the problems highlighted above. And according to many, it has done so *very* successfully.

- A relatively easily accomplishable project to boost my previously negative self-esteem
