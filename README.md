# IPA-Keyboard-iOS

**[NEW]** Update 1.0.1 is available on the App Store

An iOS keyboard for typing symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet. 

Download on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ipa-phonetic-keyboard/id1440241497

## Purpose

- Most IPA symbols cannot be typed using regular keyboards

- Full Unicode keyboards are too hard to navigate; an IPA-specific keyboard would have demand among linguistics hobbyists

- All IPA Keyboards on the App Store before mine was released were either non-free, full of ads, or poorly designed; this project aims to solve all three problems

- A relatively easily accomplishable project to boost my previously negative self-esteem

## TODO List

All items in the TODO list will be moved to Issues.

### All keyboard extensions

_Some of these features might not be allowed by the keyboard extension API_

- [ ] Ability to move the cursor using the keyboard

  * will not be able to mimic system keyboard behavior 100%; can only move cursor left and right

- [ ] Hide the switch keyboard button on devices with edge-to-edge displays (e.g. iPhone X)

  * now possible to implement due to the `needsInputModeSwitchKey` property

  * will do after/during the SwiftUI migration

### Host app

- [ ] Donations & Link to Donations 

  * If there are enough donations, some paid features can be made free
