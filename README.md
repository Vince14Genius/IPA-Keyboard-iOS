# IPA-Keyboard-iOS

**[NEW]** Update 1.0.1 is available on the App Store

An iOS keyboard for typing symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet. 

Download on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ipa-phonetic-keyboard/id1440241497

## Purpose

- Most IPA symbols cannot be typed using regular keyboards

- Full Unicode keyboards are too hard to navigate; an IPA-specific keyboard would have demand among linguistics hobbyists

- All IPA Keyboards on the App Store before mine was released were either non-free, full of ads, or poorly designed; this project aims to solve all three problems

- A relatively easily accomplishable project to boost my previously negative self-esteem

## TODO List

All items in the TODO list will be moved to Issues.
